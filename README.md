# Robocode-Project

This is my final project in AI class. 
This project is about implementing a Tank and give command to the Tank what to do in which situation. 
After I tried and improve, this is the result that I'm going to present for final presentation of that course. 
I put all the comment to understand my code. 

The bref work flow of this tank is -
 * It's know where
 * the enemies are and can lock to the target and shoot 
 * according to the distance.  

By this tank, I got the 1st runner-up in the class by fighting with my friends tanks.
